# ECG-noise-removal
A python script to process ***raw ECG waveforms*** to obtain a ***smoothened*** waveform  and thus impute from them the peaks and heartbeats.

Also, since the waveform is *denoised* to obtain a *processed* waveform, medical examinations can be conducted on it to detect certain types of diseases/disorders like **Angina, Atrial Fibrillation, Diabetes**, etc.
