# ECG-Signal-Processing
This is a basic python program that processes ***raw ECG signals*** to obtain a ***smoothened*** signal, enabling the calculation of heartbeats from the peaks.

Also, since the waveform is *denoised* to obtain a *processed* waveform, medical examinations can be conducted on it that can help in the detection of certain types of diseases/disorders like **Angina, Atrial Fibrillation, Diabetes**, etc.
